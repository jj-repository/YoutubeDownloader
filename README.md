## 🚀 Installation

### For End Users (Standalone Executables)

**📦 Zero installation required!** Download the pre-built executable for your platform:

- **Windows**: Download `YTDownloader.exe` and run it directly
- **Linux**: Download `YoutubeDownloader-Linux.tar.gz`, extract, and run `./YoutubeDownloader`

All dependencies (ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp) are bundled inside the executable. Just download and run - no additional software needed!

Get the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

#### Recommended Setup

Create a dedicated folder (e.g. `YoutubeDownloader/`) and place the executable inside. When you update yt-dlp through the app (Help > Check for Updates), a `yt-dlp` / `yt-dlp.exe` file will be downloaded next to the executable. This file is required for the app to function and must stay in the same folder. Your folder will look like:

```
YoutubeDownloader/
  YoutubeDownloader.exe   (or YoutubeDownloader on Linux)
  yt-dlp.exe              (created after first yt-dlp update)
```

To keep your desktop clean, create a shortcut to `YoutubeDownloader.exe` and place it on your desktop — that way you only see one icon while the actual files stay organized in the folder.

### For Developers

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jj-repository/YoutubeDownloader.git
   cd YoutubeDownloader

## 🎬 Trimming Feature Details

The video trimming feature allows you to:
- **Select precise time ranges** using sliders or manual time entry (HH:MM:SS)
- **See visual previews** of frames at start and end points
- **Efficient downloading** - only downloads the selected segment
- **Automatic filename generation** with timestamp range
- **Supports both video and audio trimming**

Example trimmed filename: `My Video_[00-02-30_to_00-05-15].mp4`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Formats & Compression

- **Video**: MP4 container with H.264 codec (CRF 23, medium preset)
- **Audio**: M4A format with AAC codec at 128kbps
- **Trimming**: Uses `--download-sections` for efficient partial downloads

These settings provide the best balance between file size and quality, keeping downloads as small as possible while maintaining good visual/audio fidelity.

### Architecture & Performance

- **Thread Pool**: Maximum 3 concurrent worker threads for optimal resource usage
- **LRU Cache**: Caches up to 20 preview frames for instant access
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s delays)
- **Timeout Protection**:
  - 30-minute absolute download limit
  - 5-minute stall detection (no progress)
- **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cleanup of temp files and old cache entries
